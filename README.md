# Indian Flag using Turtle in Python

This project demonstrates how to create the Indian flag using the Turtle graphics library in Python.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The `turtle` library, which is included in the Python standard library.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```
   python --version
   ```

   If the command returns the Python version, you're good to go. Otherwise, download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to start the program:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

   This will launch the Python script, and you will see a window displaying the Indian flag.

4. The flag will be drawn using the Turtle graphics library, and you can close the window by clicking on the "X" button or pressing the escape key.

## Customization

If you want to customize the flag, you can modify the `main.py` file. Inside the script, you will find comments indicating different sections of the flag, such as the saffron color, the white color, and the green color. You can change the dimensions, colors, or any other aspect of the flag by modifying the corresponding code.

```python
# Saffron color
turtle.fillcolor("#FF9933")

# White color
turtle.fillcolor("#FFFFFF")

# Green color
turtle.fillcolor("#138808")
```

Feel free to experiment and create your own variations of the Indian flag!

## Acknowledgements

This project is inspired by the spirit of patriotism and the beauty of the Indian flag. The Turtle graphics library provides a simple and intuitive way to draw shapes and create graphical programs in Python.
